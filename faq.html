    <div id="sub" class="faqHeader">How does this work?</div>
    <div class="faqText"style="margin-left:3vw; margin-top:.8vw;">1) Make a deposit on the "Deposit" page from a wallet you want to have privacy. NOTE: this action is public.</div>
    <div class="faqText"style="margin-left:3vw">2) On the "Account Summary" page, create a transaction by inputting a destination address and a value to be sent. Gas is not required for this step.</div>
    <div class="faqText"style="margin-left:3vw"><b>NOTE:</b> CoinStir allows for funds to be sent to anyone without them having visibility as to where exactly the funds came from. The recipiant will only see that the funds came from "CoinStir" and not who originally put them there. This is analogous for what someone would see if you were to receive funds from a Centralized Exchange (CEX).</div>
    <div class="faqHeader">Does anyone have access to my funds while they are in CoinStir?</div>
    <div class="faqText"style="margin-left:3vw; margin-top:.8vw;">Absolutely not. Neither CoinStir nor any other entity related to CoinStir has any control over your funds whatsoever. They are entirely controlled by you, and further, it is completely free to deposit and withdraw funds. A fee is only charged upon creating a transaction.</div>
    <div class="faqHeader">Is this just a mixer?</div>
    <div class="faqText"style="margin-left:3vw; margin-top:.8vw;">While both CoinStir and a mixer prevent others from seeing a clear path of where funds have gone to or have been received from, there are 2 critical differences: Firstly, CoinStir is intended to act as a dashboard allowing users to easily manage their network of accounts. The user will be able to manage multiple accounts from one location. Secondly, CoinStir has mechanisms in place for governmental oversight. This is to ensure compliance with any laws a user might be held to, and to prevent money-laundering.</div>
    <div class="faqHeader">Why not use a CEX to hide your account balance instead?</div>
    <div class="faqText"style="margin-left:3vw; margin-top:.8vw;">History has shown us that CEX's most certainly can take total control of your assets. In some cases, irresponsible or deceptive business practices have led CEX's to seize users assets to cover the negligent business practices of the CEX, at no fault of the user. CoinStir does not have any control over your assets, nor does it use those assets for anything while they are deposited. While this does mean the user will not earn any interest on funds held in CoinStir, it does ensure that the funds are right where the user left them upon deposit, and are always available for withdraw.</div>
    <div class="faqHeader">How can I learn more?</div>
    <div class="faqText"style="margin-left:3vw; margin-top:.8vw;">Further documentation coming soon!</div>
